# ü§ô Raffaele Valenti

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/3D Artist)`**

Hi there! Allow me to provide a brief introduction of myself. I go by the name Raffaele Valenti and at 25 years old, I proudly identify as an Italian digital craftsman.
<br />
Curious about what a digital craftsman does? Let me give you a quick overview. Traditionally, a craftsman is known for practicing a craft, essentially an artisan. While I may not excel in "hardware" craftsmanship like a carpenter working with wood, my forte lies in crafting within the digital realm. Hence, the term digital craftsman.
<br />
Now that I've shed light on this, shall we return to my self-presentation?

    <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey</h3></summary>
    Technology has always held a fascination for me, and my foray into the realm of digital crafting began in my teenage years.
    <br />
    To this day, I find immense joy in video games, and at one point, I decided to delve into the world of game development. My exploration led me to the widely known game engine, <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, where I began learning the ropes of both Unity and the C# programming language primarily through insightful YouTube tutorials.
    <br />
    After grasping the fundamentals of Unity and C#, I expanded my horizons within game development, delving into artistic aspects such as 2D and 3D art. I mastered tools like <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> for texture creation and <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> for crafting intricate 3D models. Progressing further, I acquainted myself with advanced programs like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/substance3d-painter.html">Substance Painter</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/substance3d-designer.html">Substance Designer</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Concurrently, alongside game development, I ventured into web development, starting with the basics of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, later transitioning to frameworks like <a href="https://it.reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, and snippets of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    A few years later, my passion led me to <a href="https://www.bohemia.net/">Bohemia Interactive</a>'s game <a href="https://arma3.com/">Arma 3</a>, where I ventured into modding and gained recognition within the Italian gaming community.
    <br />
    <br />
    In October 2017, having graduated from high school, I embarked on a two-year post-diploma course to become a biomedical informatics technician. The program enriched my knowledge in practical areas like C, Java, web development, Android app development, databases, and my favorite, AR, VR, and mixed reality development. The curriculum also covered theoretical subjects such as mathematics, networking, laws and regulations (primarily for medical equipment), and software engineering. Graduating at the top of my class in mid-2019, I felt a sense of accomplishment.
    <br />
    Subsequently, until April 2021, I pursued a university degree in software engineering. Unfortunately, due to a combination of events and challenges, I made the difficult decision to discontinue my studies. However, this marked the beginning of my professional journey as I secured my first job as a software developer at <a href="https://www.fincantieri.com/it/">FINCANTIERI S.p.A.</a>, where I am still employed today.
    <br />
    <br />
    Throughout this period, I continually honed my skills and pursued self-improvement. By the end of 2022, I acquired my first 3D printer, enabling me to materialize my Blender creations in the tangible world.

# ü§ô Raffaele Valenti

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/3D Artist)`**

Hi there! Let me breafly introduce myself: my name is Raffaele Valenti and I'm a 24-years-old italian digital craftsman.
<br />
What's a digital craftsman you may ask? I'll be quick, but let's start form the beginning: a craftsman is someone who practises a craft; an artisan. I'm not particularly skilled on any "hardware" work like, for example, a carpenter who works with wood, but I have skills that allow me to craft in the digital world. Hence, the term digital craftsman.
<br />
Well, after this short explanation why don't we go back to my brief presentation?

    <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey</h3></summary>
    Technology has always attracted me, but I began my journey into the world of digital crafting in my teens.
    <br />
    To this day I also very much enjoy video games and one day I decided to teach myself how to develop them. After a little search I stombled upon a game engine that absolutely no one knows called <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> (of course I'm beeing sarcastic üòÅ) and I started learning it and the C# programming language, mostly through YouTube videos.
    <br />
    After learing the basics of Unity and C# programming I started dipping my toes into other fields of game development, like art, both 2D and 3D. I learned how to use <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to create textures and <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to make hard surface 3D models. Later on I started learning more advanced programs like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/substance3d-painter.html">Substance Painter</a> and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/it/products/substance3d-designer.html">Substance Designer</a>.
    <br />
    A couple of years later I became very hooked on <a href="https://www.bohemia.net/">Bohemia Interactive</a>'s video game <a href="https://arma3.com/">Arma 3</a> and I got into modding. I was pretty good at it and I got quite famous in the italian community.
    <br />
    While I was learning game development related technologies, I also learned web development, first plain HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, then switching to frameworks like <a href="https://it.reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> and bits of <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.
    <br />
    In October 2017, after graduating from highschool, I started attending a 2-years-long post-diploma course to become a biomedical informatics technician. During those two years I met some amazing people and I developed even more the skill that I already had and aquired some new ones. The course had lessions for more practical knowledge, like basics of C and more in-depth Java and web development, Android apps development, databases and finally, my favourite one, AR, VR and mixed reality development, but also less practical ones like mathematics, networking, laws and regulations (mostly for medical equipment) and software engineering. I graduated in mid 2019 at the top of my class.
    <br />
    From then until April 2021 I attended university and I tried get the degree to become a software engineer, but, unfortunately, due to some combination of events and difficulties, I dropped out. In the end I found my first job, and I became a software developer in <a href="https://www.fincantieri.com/it/">FINCANTIERI S.p.A.</a>, in which I'm still employed to this day.
    <br />
    All of this time I kept improving myself and I kept following my path of self-learning. I got to know more of C and C++, I started learning and developing my own game engine (I'm still learning about it, not fully developing yet) and by the end of 2022 I bought my first 3D printer, allowing me to use my knowledge of Blender to bring to the real world my creations.
